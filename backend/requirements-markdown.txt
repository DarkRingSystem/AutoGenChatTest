# Optional dependencies for Markdown conversion features
# Note: These have dependency conflicts with autogen-core
# Install separately if you need Markdown conversion functionality

# marker-pdf==1.10.1
# weasyprint>=66.0
# mammoth>=1.11.0

# WARNING: marker-pdf requires Pillow<11.0.0, but autogen-core requires Pillow>=11.0.0
# This creates a dependency conflict that cannot be resolved automatically.
# 
# If you need both features, you may need to:
# 1. Use separate virtual environments
# 2. Wait for package updates that resolve the conflict
# 3. Use alternative Markdown conversion tools
